# FAHMMGlobalStats

A collection of little Python scripts to 

1. read the daily user statistics from FAH and collect those data into a SQLite DB
2. Listen to a port and receive user names and device tokens
3. Shell script called once an hour from a crontab to trigger all that stuff (you need to change the home-dir)
